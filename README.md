Hey whoever is reading this et al!

I'm Moobacca. I am completing this as part of the preparation course for Lighthouse Labs' 8-week iOS Development course which I hope to partake in very soon! Unfortunately, I'm not sure exactly when I will take it, because I am currently a third year Business Administration student in Victoria, BC. Lighthouse is located in Vancouver, 3.5 hours away. I can't wait to start the iOS Dev course; I think it will be challenging, fun, and rewarding. My only coding experience thus far lies in Dreamweaver; I made a very basic website for a fabled phtography company. GASP!
